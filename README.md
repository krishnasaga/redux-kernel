# Redux Kernel

## Redux and RxJS based frontend application development framework inspired by Linux Kernal and SICP

> We believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large soware systems

- Redux plays role of C to develop linux kernal
- We provide high level APIs for developers to manage state by controlling intelictual complexity

> The primery puprops of this project is to explore complex intelectual ideas and create simple abstractoins.
